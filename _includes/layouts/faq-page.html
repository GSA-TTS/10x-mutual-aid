          <div class="question">
            <h3>What is mutual aid?</h3>
            <p>Mutual aid is a straightforward concept where state and local governments step in to assist each other in
              the wake of a catastrophic event. Typically, mutual aid provides personnel or resources to affected
              communities in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The main goal is to accelerate community recovery
              and reduce future risks. While mutual aid resources are often provided without charge, it's worth noting
              that specific arrangements can vary depending on the agreements in place between jurisdictions.</p>

          <div class="question">
            <h3>What is mutual aid for building departments?</h3>
            <p>Natural disasters can often leave local building officials overwhelmed with the task of assessing
              structural damage and ensuring public safety. Mutual aid for building departments is a straightforward
              concept where skilled professionals from neighboring jurisdictions step in to assist communities with
              inspections, hazard mitigation, and other building department functions in the wake of a catastrophic
              event.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>Who responds to mutual aid for building departments? </h3>
            <p>Typically, mutual aid can provide communities with additional building inspectors, plan reviewers, or
              code enforcement officers in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. These are often civil servants from
              neighboring communities and states. In some cases, mutual aid responders can also include private
              engineers, architects and other skilled professionals. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>What assistance can mutual aid provide to a building department? </h3>
            <p>Mutual aid can provide additional building inspectors, plan reviewers, and code enforcement officers to a
              building department in need. These professionals can help conduct rapid damage assessments, determine
              building safety, and process emergency permits following a disaster. They can also assist with routine
              inspections and plan reviews during periods of high workload or staff shortages. This support helps the
              local building department maintain service levels, ensure public safety, and expedite recovery efforts.

          <div class="question">
            <h3>Does mutual aid for building departments work the same in every state?</h3>
            <p>The details of implementation, resource sharing, and reimbursement can differ significantly from one
              state to another. Some states have formalized statewide mutual aid systems, while others rely more on
              local or regional agreements. It's important for building officials to understand their state's specific
              mutual aid framework and any interstate compacts that may apply. The state search tool on our <a
                class="usa-link" href="{{ '/' | url }}">main page</a> can help you begin to explore your state's mutual
              aid system.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>Are there protections against liability?</h3>
            <p>Many states have enacted legislation that offers some degree of liability protection for mutual aid
              providers lending assistance under official mutual aid agreements. This protection can vary depending on
              state laws and specific mutual aid agreements. The contacts provided by our search tool can help you
              understand the liability protections in place for your individual situation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>Will mutual aid cost my community?</h3>
            <p>Reimbursement between communities in the same state can vary by state, as each state, district, and
              territory has its own specific regulations and procedures. Typically, the requesting community (the one
              that received aid) is responsible for reimbursing the assisting community for eligible costs. This usually
              follows a "neighbor helping neighbor" principle, where the community benefiting from the assistance bears
              the financial responsibility. Some states have established funds or mechanisms to help cover these costs,
              especially in cases of larger emergencies or disasters. In such instances, the state might step in to
              reimburse the assisting communities directly or provide funds to the requesting community for this
              purpose.</p>
            <p>Under the Emergency Mutual Aid Compact (EMAC), which facilitates interstate assistance, the requesting
              state is responsible for reimbursing the assisting state, but this is often eligible for federal disaster
              reimbursement. However, it's important to note that while the immediate deployment may not have an upfront
              cost, your community may need to budget for potential reimbursements or cost-sharing depending on the
              specific agreement and disaster declaration status. For example, the standard cost-share for FEMA Public
              Assistance is typically 75% federal and 25% non-federal, though this can sometimes be adjusted for
              catastrophic events. The requesting state would be responsible for the non-federal share, which they may
              pass on to the local jurisdiction that received the aid.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>Is an emergency declaration required to utilize mutual aid for building departments? </h3>
            <p>Mutual aid for building departments can often be activated without a formal disaster declaration. Many
              communities have agreements in place that allow for cooperation and resource sharing for smaller-scale
              incidents that do not meet the threshold for a disaster declaration. However, it is important to note that
              the specific rules and procedures can vary depending on your local and state regulations. Some areas may
              have specific requirements for activating mutual aid, while others maintain flexible systems for sharing
              resources.</p>
            <p>In cases of larger disasters, a formal declaration can unlock additional resources and funding streams,
              potentially making it easier to cover the costs of mutual aid. For interstate assistance through the
              Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), a governor's declaration is required. EMAC is a national
              interstate mutual aid agreement that enables states to share resources during large-scale disasters. Under
              EMAC, the governor of the affected state must declare a state of emergency and request assistance before
              other states can send aid. This process ensures a coordinated response and helps establish eligibility for
              federal reimbursement.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <h3>What costs are eligible for reimbursement?</h3>
            <p>When it comes to reimbursement under IMAC (Intrastate Mutual Aid Compact) and EMAC (Emergency Management
              Assistance Compact), eligible costs can vary depending on the specific state agreements and the nature of
              the emergency. Generally, reimbursable expenses often include personnel costs (such as salaries, overtime,
              and benefits), travel expenses, equipment usage, and supplies directly related to the mutual aid response.
              Some agreements may also cover costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses for deployed personnel.
            </p>
            <p>To ensure proper reimbursement, it's essential for both requesting and assisting entities <span
                class="text-bold">to carefully document all expenses</span> and follow the specific guidelines outlined
              in their state's mutual aid agreements.</p>
