Licensed architects and engineers may register as volunteer Disaster Service Workers for the Safety Assessment Program administered by the California Office of Emergency Services to provide safety assessments of damaged facilities during emergencies. Registered Disaster Service Workers can receive workersâ€™ compensation coverage for injuries/illnesses sustained while performing disaster service (but see cited regulations for details and specific requirements).

Volunteers duly enrolled or registered with the Office of Emergency Services, or any disaster council of any political subdivision, and unregistered persons duly impressed into service during a state of emergency or local emergency, if they are complying or attempting to comply with the relevant laws, regulations or orders (see cited statute), have the same degree of responsibility for their actions and enjoy the same immunities as officers and employees of the state or its local governments would have if performing similar work for their respective entities.
