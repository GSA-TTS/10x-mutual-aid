State broadly defines “Emergency Services” as all activities, other than functions for which military forces or other federal agencies are primarily responsible, to minimize damage resulting from disasters, and explicitly includes engineering. State defines “Emergency Management Worker” to include any full- or part-time paid, volunteer, or auxiliary employee of any agency or organization performing emergency management services in the state subject to the order or control of, or pursuant to a request of, the state or a political subdivision thereof. State explicitly empowers the governor and political subdivisions to accept services and resources offered by private entities for emergency management purposes.
